 To perform the experiment for the M/G/1/N queueing model, follow these steps sequentially:

1. **Set Simulation Parameters**:
   - Begin by configuring the simulation parameters. Set the values for the mean arrival rate.
   - Select the appropriate service time distribution (e.g., exponential, normal).
   - Set the mean service rate.
   - Define the maximum number of customers N that the system can accommodate.

2. **Ensure Steady-State Conditions**:
   - Verify that the mean arrival rate is less than the mean service rate. This condition is necessary to ensure the system reaches a steady state, where the arrival rate is balanced by the service rate, preventing the queue from growing indefinitely.

3. **Start the Experiment**:
   - Click the 'Start' button to initiate the simulation. The system will begin processing customers based on the specified parameters.

4. **Stop the Experiment and View Results**:
   - Click the 'Stop' button to halt the simulation once it has run for a sufficient period. This allows for the collection of data.
   - View the steady-state results both numerically and graphically. Numerical results might include metrics such as average queue length, blocking probability, and server utilization. Graphical results might display time-based trends or distributions.

5. **Compare Theoretical and Experimental Results**:
   - Compare the results obtained from the simulation with the theoretical predictions. This comparison helps validate the accuracy of the theoretical model and provides insights into the system's performance under different conditions.
