      "question": "In a finite capacity single server queue with exponential arrivals and general distributed service (M/G/1/N), what does 'N' represent?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Number of servers in the system",
        "b": "Arrival rate of customers",
        "c": "Maximum number of customers allowed in the system",
        "d": "Service rate of the server"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. 'N' does not represent the number of servers in the system.",
        "b": "Incorrect. 'N' does not represent the arrival rate of customers.",
        "c": "Correct. In the M/G/1/N queueing system, 'N' signifies the maximum number of customers allowed in the system at any given time before new arrivals are rejected.",
        "d": "Incorrect. 'N' does not represent the service rate of the server."

      "question": "In the given queueing model, what distribution is assumed for customer service times?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "General distribution",
        "b": "Gaussian distribution",
        "c": "Uniform distribution",
        "d": "Poisson distribution"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. In the M/G/1/N queueing model, customer service times are assumed to follow an general distribution.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The M/G/1/N model assumes general distributed service, not specifically a Gaussian distribution.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The M/G/1/N model assumes general distributed service, not specifically a uniform distribution.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The M/G/1/N model assumes general distributed service, not specifically a Poisson distribution."

    {
      "question": "What does the 'M' stand for in the notation M/G/1/N?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Markovian arrival process",
        "b": "Maximum queue length",
        "c": "Memoryless service time distribution",
        "d": "Minimum number of customers in the system"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. In the M/G/1/N notation, 'M' stands for Markovian arrival process.",
        "b": "Incorrect. 'M' does not represent the maximum queue length in the M/G/1/N notation.",
        "c": "Incorrect. 'M' does not represent memoryless service time distribution.",
        "d": "Incorrect. 'M' does not represent the minimum number of customers in the system."

    {
      "question": "If the arrival rate of customers exceeds the service rate of the server in the M/G/1/N queue, what is likely to happen?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The queue will empty quickly",
        "b": "Customers will leave the system",
        "c": "The queue will grow indefinitely",
        "d": "The server will increase its service rate"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. If the arrival rate exceeds the service rate, the queue is likely to grow, not empty out quickly.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Customers are likely to stay in the system, contributing to the queue growth.",
        "c": "Correct. When the arrival rate exceeds the service rate, the queue is unable to clear, causing it to grow indefinitely.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The server's service rate does not automatically increase in response to the queue growing due to excess arrivals."
      },
